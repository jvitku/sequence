HANNS project - Nodes for Logic Operations
================================================

Author Jaroslav Vitku [vitkujar@fel.cvut.cz]


About
------

This is a part of Hybrid Artificial Neural Network Systems (HANNS) project (see: http://artificiallife.co.nf ). 

Each node can be connected into a potentially heterogeneous network of nodes communicating via the ROS, potentially Nengoros ( http://nengoros.wordpress.com ). 

This is ROS meta-package (currently without direct catkin support), a collection of ROS(java) nodes.

 
Purpose of this repository
-----------------------

This repository holds ROS nodes with implementation of some *sequence recognition and prediction* algorithms.


Technical notes
---------------

This is a collection of as domain-independent nodes as possible: run the node, send data in and receive the result. 


Installation
------------------

The best way how to install these nodes so far, is to use them as a part of the NengoRos project (see: https://github.com/jvitku/nengoros )
